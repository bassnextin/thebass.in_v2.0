                   As a matter of policy, we do not sell or rent any personally identifiable information about you to any third party. However, the following describes some of the ways that your personally identifiable information may be disclosed:<br>
                   a.	External Service Providers: There may be a number of services offered by external service providers that help you use our Platform. If you choose to use these optional services, and in the course of doing so, disclose information to the external service providers, and/or grant them permission to collect information about you, then their use of your information is governed by their privacy policy.<br>
                   b.	Law and Order: We cooperate with law enforcement inquiries, as well as other third parties to enforce laws, such as intellectual property rights, fraud and other rights. We can (and you authorize us to) disclose any information about you to law enforcement and other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate, in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose us or you to legal liability.<br><br>

                   <strong>13.	  ACCESSING, REVIEWING AND CHANGING YOUR PROFILE</strong><br>

                   Following registration, you can review and change the information you submitted at the stage of registration, except Email ID and mobile number. An option for facilitating such change shall be present on the Platform and such change shall be facilitated by the User. If you change any information, we may or may not keep track of your old information. We will not retain in our files information you have requested to remove for certain circumstances, such as to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our terms and conditions. Such prior information shall be completely removed from our databases, including stored ‘back up’ systems. If you believe that any information, we are holding on you is incorrect or incomplete, or to remove your profile so that others cannot view it, the User needs to remediate, and promptly correct any such incorrect information.<br><br>

                   <strong>14.	CONTROL OF YOUR PASSWORD</strong><br>

                   You are entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password. It is important that you protect it against unauthorized access of your account and information by choosing your password carefully and keeping your password and computer secure by signing out after using our services.
                   You agree not to use the account, username, email address or password of another Member at any time or to disclose your password to any third party. You are responsible for all actions taken with your login information and password, including fees. If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your personally identifiable information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately change your password. You agree to notify us immediately if you suspect any consistent unauthorized use of your account or access to your password even after changing it.<br><br>

                   <strong>15.	   SECURITY</strong><br>

                   We treat data as an asset that must be protected against loss and unauthorized access. We employ many different security techniques to protect such data from unauthorized access by members inside and outside the Company. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to us and information that we have accessed.
                   However, as effective as encryption technology is, no security system is impenetrable. Our Company cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that information you provide won’t be intercepted while being transmitted to the Company over the Internet.<br><br>

                   <strong>16.	  SEVERABILITY</strong><br>

                   Each paragraph of this Privacy Policy shall be and remain separate from and independent of and severable from all and any other paragraphs herein except where otherwise expressly indicated or indicated by the context of the agreement. The decision or declaration that one or more of the paragraphs are null and void shall have no effect on the remaining paragraphs of this privacy policy.<br><br>

                   <strong>17.	  AMENDMENT</strong><br>

                   Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time. The most current version of the policy will govern our use of your information and will always be at the Platform. Any amendments to this Policy shall be deemed as accepted by the User on their continued use of the Platform.<br><br>

                   <strong>18.	  AUTOMATED DECISION MAKING</strong><br>

                   As a responsible Company, we do not use automatic decision-making or profiling.<br><br>

                   <strong>19.	  CONSENT WITHDRAWAL, DATA DOWNLOAD & DATA REMOVAL REQUESTS</strong><br>

                   To withdraw your consent, or to request the download or delete your data with us for any or all our services & services at any time, please email to <a href="mailto:support@thebass.in?subject=data_consent">support@thebass.in</a>.<br><br>

                   <strong>20.	 CONTACT US</strong><br>

                   If you have any questions or concerns regarding this privacy policy, you should contact us by sending an e-mail to please email to <a href="mailto:support@thebass.in?subject=queries">support@thebass.in</a>.<br>
